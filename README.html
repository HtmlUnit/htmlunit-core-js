This project is a Rhino fork, maintained to support features needed by HtmlUnit.

To build the project, you have to use ant.

buid.xml is the original Rhino build file, and htmlunit.xml is the one used by HtmlUnit. 

Notice that "org.mozilla.*" is automatically renamed to "net.sourceforge.htmlunit.corejs.*"

Run "ant -f htmlunit.xml -p -v" to see all the tasks available

Mostly you will need:
"ant -f htmlunit.xml jar-all"
